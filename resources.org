** Dealing with scRNA-seq data
*** ACE - Dimensionality reduction and neuralised clustering for single-cell data [[[http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/lu21e/lu21e.pdf][paper]], [[https://bitbucket.org/noblelab/ace/src/master/][code]]]
ACE is a methodology that combines dimensionality reduction and clustering on scRNA-seq data in order to identify distinct cell subgroups. ACE asks what expression profiles most distinctly identify the membership of a cell to a particular cell cluster. It constitutes 3 components:
1. An autoencoder component to perform dimensionality reduction.
2. A neuralised clustering algorithm to prescribe group membership that acts on the low dimensional output of the autoencoder.
3. An adversarial perturbation routine to identify explanitory gene combinations.
This is done in an end-to-end differentiable manner, employing a joint loss function to jointly optimise the clustering and embedding.

ACE takes a single-cell gene expression matrix as input.

*** SAUCIE - Exploring single-cell data with deep multitasking neural networks [[[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0576-7][paper]], [[https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/SAUCIE/][code]]]
SAUCIE is a popular autoencoder for performing dimensionality reduction on scRNA-seq data. Notably, it is the encoder part of the ACE system.
