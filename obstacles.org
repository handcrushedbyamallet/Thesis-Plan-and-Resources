#+TITLE: Obstacles

This document contains obstacles in performing trajectory inference, dealing with single-cell data and the like. It contains issues both for creating a differentiable TI method, but also issues with current TI procedures that may be addressed by differentiable programming.

* Batch effects
Batch effects is a term used to descrive when non-biological factors are responsible for measurable observations in the data.
** Solutions
The umbrella turm used to describe methods that deal with batch effects is "batch correction" techniques.

*** Autoencoder models

* Noise
** Capture efficiency
** Sequencing depth
** Solutions
*** Probabalistic models

* High-dimensional data
Techniques in dimensionality reduction of single-cell data usually assume that a manifold underlies structure of the cells x genes data that can be represented by a generalised linear model. This fails to take into account epistatic effects or any non-linear effects that may be present in cells gene expression.
** Solutions

* Sparse data
** Solutions
*** Zero-inflated models (usually zero-inflated negative binomial)
Zero-inflated models are models based on distributions that allow for frequent zero valued observations.
