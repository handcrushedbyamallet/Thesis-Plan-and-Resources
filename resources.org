** Dealing with scRNA-seq data
*** ACE - Dimensionality reduction and neuralised clustering for scRNA-seq data [[[http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/lu21e/lu21e.pdf][paper]], [[https://bitbucket.org/noblelab/ace/src/master/][code]]]
ACE is a methodology that combines dimensionality reduction and clustering on scRNA-seq data in order to identify distinct cell subgroups. ACE asks what expression profiles most distinctly identify the membership of a cell to a particular cell cluster. It constitutes 3 components:
1. An autoencoder component to perform dimensionality reduction.
2. A neuralised clustering algorithm to prescribe group membership that acts on the low dimensional output of the autoencoder.
3. An adversarial perturbation routine to identify explanitory gene combinations.
